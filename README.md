# ðŸ©º Pneumonia Detection Using CNN (VGG-16)

This project applies advanced computer vision techniques using convolutional neural networks to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection. Leveraging transfer learning with the pretrained VGG-16 architecture, it aims to assist in accurate and automated diagnosis.

## ðŸ§  Problem Formulation

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection diagnosed primarily via chest X-rays. Manual diagnosis requires expert radiologists and can be time-consuming. This project builds a machine learning model to automatically detect pneumonia in X-ray images, improving speed and consistency of diagnosis.
